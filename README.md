Scalext
=======

A scala library that enable the creation of contextual DSLs, inspired by the routing module of [Spray](http://spray.io/).

It uses part of the internal code of [spray-routing](https://github.com/spray/spray/tree/master/spray-routing/src/main/scala/spray/routing) and its directives, but enables developers to use their own contexts and create their own DSL.

Set up the dependencies
-----------------------

Scalext is available at my [S3 Repository](http://shrub.appspot.com/bfil-mvn-repo), and it is cross compiled and published for both Scala 2.10 and 2.11.

Using SBT, add the following plugin:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.frugalmechanic" % "fm-sbt-s3-resolver" % "0.2.0")
```

Add the following dependency to your SBT build file:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.bfil" %% "scalext" % "0.1.0"
)
```

Don't forget to add the following resolver:

```scala
resolvers += "BFil S3 Repo Releases" at "s3://bfil-mvn-repo.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/releases"
```

### Using snapshots

If you need a snapshot dependency:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.bfil" %% "scalext" % "0.2.0-SNAPSHOT"
)

resolvers += "BFil S3 Repo Snapshots" at "s3://bfil-mvn-repo.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/snapshots"
```

Usage
-----

To build your own DSL all you need to do is:

 1. define your custom context object
 2. define the DSL actions

### A basic example

Let's use a simple calculator DSL as an example.

The calculator DSL context will be a simple class that stores a promise object (which will resolve into a future result at some point) and the current calculation value.

The _ArihmeticContext_ object can be a simple case class:

```scala
case class ArithmeticContext(resultPromise: Promise[Double], value: Double)
```

The DSL actions will manipulate this context, we can put the actions in a _CalculatorDsl_ trait:

```scala
trait CalculatorDsl extends ContextualDsl[ArithmeticContext] {
  // actions in here..
}
```

The first action triggering the DSL logic needs to accept an _Action_ as a parameter.

In this example we create an initial action _startWith_ that accepts an initial value, it creates the _ArithmeticContext_ storing the initial value and a promise, and it passes the newly created context into the action specified.

```scala
def startWith(initialValue: Long)(action: Action) = {
  val p = Promise[Double]
  action(ArithmeticContext(p, initialValue)) 
  p.future
}
```

The above method returns the future associated with the promise, so that we can resolve the promise at a later point when we want to return a result.

Let's define some basic actions for the DSL (_add_, _subtract_, _multiplyBy_, and _divideBy_), the actions use the _mapContext_ helper method of the _ContextualDsl_ trait, which modifies the immutable context and passes it through to the inner action.

```scala
def add(value: Double) = mapContext(ctx => ctx.copy(value = ctx.value + value))
def subtract(value: Double) = mapContext(ctx => ctx.copy(value = ctx.value - value))
def multiplyBy(value: Double) = mapContext(ctx => ctx.copy(value = ctx.value * value))
def divideBy(value: Double) = mapContext(ctx => ctx.copy(value = ctx.value / value))
```

The inner most method of the DSL usually must be a simple action that takes the context object and returns Unit, what we want to do is completing the promise by passing in it the result of our calculation.
  
```scala
  def returnResult = ActionResult { ctx => ctx.resultPromise.completeWith(Future { ctx.value }) }
```

We called our final action _returnResult_, and we defined it using the apply method of the _ActionResult_ object, which makes the code more readable, but it could just be a simple method with the signature _Context => Unit_.

Finally using our _CalculatorDsl_ in our code will look like this:

```scala
class Calculator extends CalculatorDsl {
  def performCalculation: Future[Double] = 
    startWith(2) {
      add(3) {
        multiplyBy(3) {
          subtract(5) {
            divideBy(2) {
              returnResult
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
}
```

This is just a simple example of how the library can be used to create DSLs that manipulate a context.
