Scalext
=======

A scala library that enable the creation of contextual DSLs, inspired by the routing module of [Spray](http://spray.io/).

It uses part of the internal code of [spray-routing](https://github.com/spray/spray/tree/master/spray-routing/src/main/scala/spray/routing) and its directives, but enables developers to use their own contexts and create their own DSL.

Set up the dependencies
-----------------------

Scalext is available at my [S3 Repository](http://shrub.appspot.com/bfil-mvn-repo), and it is cross compiled and published for both Scala 2.10 and 2.11.

Using SBT, add the following plugin:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.frugalmechanic" % "fm-sbt-s3-resolver" % "0.2.0")
```

Add the following dependency to your SBT build file:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.bfil" %% "scalext" % "0.1.0"
)
```

Don't forget to add the following resolver:

```scala
resolvers += "BFil S3 Repo Releases" at "s3://bfil-mvn-repo.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/releases"
```

### Using snapshots

If you need a snapshot dependency:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.bfil" %% "scalext" % "0.2.0-SNAPSHOT"
)

resolvers += "BFil S3 Repo Snapshots" at "s3://bfil-mvn-repo.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/snapshots"
```
