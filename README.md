A scala library that enable the creation of contextual DSLs, inspired by the routing module of [Spray](http://spray.io/).

It uses part of the internal code of [spray-routing](https://github.com/spray/spray/tree/master/spray-routing/src/main/scala/spray/routing) and its directives, but enables to use custom contexts and create a context-specific DSL.

Setting up the dependencies
---------------------------

__Scalext__ is available on `Maven Central` (since version `0.4.0`), and it is cross compiled and published for Scala 2.12, 2.11 and 2.10.

*Older artifacts versions are not available anymore due to the shutdown of my self-hosted Nexus Repository in favour of Bintray*

Using SBT, add the following dependency to your build file:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "io.bfil" %% "scalext" % "0.4.0"
)
```

If you have issues resolving the dependency, you can add the following resolver:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("bfil", "maven")
```

Usage
-----

To build your own DSL all you need to do is:

 1. define your custom context object
 2. define the DSL actions

### A basic example

Let's use a simple calculator DSL as an example.

The calculator DSL context will be a simple class that stores a promise object (which will resolve into a future result at some point) and the current calculation value.

The `ArihmeticContext` object can be a simple case class:

```scala
case class ArithmeticContext(resultPromise: Promise[Double], value: Double)
```

The DSL actions will manipulate this context, we can put the actions in a `CalculatorDsl` trait:

```scala
trait CalculatorDsl extends ContextualDsl[ArithmeticContext] {
  // actions in here..
}
```

The first action triggering the DSL logic needs to accept an `Action` as a parameter.

In this example we create an initial action `startWith` that accepts an initial value, it creates the `ArithmeticContext` storing the initial value and a promise, and it passes the newly created context into the action specified.

```scala
def startWith(initialValue: Long)(action: Action) = {
  val p = Promise[Double]
  action(ArithmeticContext(p, initialValue))
  p.future
}
```

The above method returns the future associated with the promise, so that we can resolve the promise at a later point when we want to return a result.

Let's define some basic actions for the DSL (`add`, `subtract`, `multiplyBy`, and `divideBy`), the actions use the `mapContext` helper method of the `ContextualDsl` trait, which modifies the immutable context and passes it through to the inner action.

```scala
def add(value: Double) = mapContext(ctx => ctx.copy(value = ctx.value + value))
def subtract(value: Double) = mapContext(ctx => ctx.copy(value = ctx.value - value))
def multiplyBy(value: Double) = mapContext(ctx => ctx.copy(value = ctx.value * value))
def divideBy(value: Double) = mapContext(ctx => ctx.copy(value = ctx.value / value))
```

The inner most method of the DSL usually must be a simple action that takes the context object and returns Unit, what we want to do is completing the promise by passing in it the result of our calculation.

```scala
  def returnResult = ActionResult { ctx => ctx.resultPromise.completeWith(Future { ctx.value }) }
```

We called our final action `returnResult`, and we defined it using the apply method of the `ActionResult` object, which makes the code more readable, but it could just be a simple method with the signature `Context => Unit`.

Finally using our `CalculatorDsl` in our code will look like this:

```scala
class Calculator extends CalculatorDsl {
  def performCalculation: Future[Double] =
    startWith(2) {
      add(3) {
        multiplyBy(3) {
          subtract(5) {
            divideBy(2) {
              returnResult
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
}
```

This is just a simple example of how the library can be used to create DSLs that manipulate a context.

### Documentation

The main components of __Scalext__ are the `ContextualDsl` trait and the DSL actions.

#### Contextual DSL

The `ContextualDsl` trait accepts a context type parameter

```scala
trait ContextualDsl[T]
```

Extending the `ContextualDsl` trait enables the creation of DSL actions

```scala
case class ExampleContext()
trait MyDsl extends ContextualDsl[ExampleContext] {
  // actions in here..
}
```

DSL Actions are methods that accepts a context and return Unit

```scala
type Action = Context => Unit
```

#### DSL Actions

The following DSL actions can be used as basic helpers to create other DSL actions

__mapContext__

```scala
mapContext(f: Context => Context)
```

It maps the context to a new context and passes it into the inner action:

```scala
mapContext ( ctx => updateContext(ctx) ) {
  ctx => Unit
}
```

__provide__

```scala
provide[T](value: T)
```

It provides/passes a value into the inner action:

```scala
provide ( "hello" ) { str =>
  ctx => println(str) // hello
}
```

__extract__

```scala
extract[T](f: Context => T)
```

It extracts a value from the context and passes it into the inner action:

```scala
extract ( ctx => ctx.total ) { total =>
  ctx => println(total)
}
```

__onComplete__

```scala
onComplete[T](f: => Future[T])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext)
onComplete[T](f: Context => Future[T])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext)
```

It waits for the completion of a future a passes the future result into the inner action:

```scala
onComplete ( Future { "hello" } ) {
  case Success(str) => ctx => println(str) // hello
  case Failure(ex) => throw ex
}
```

It can also accept as a parameter a function that returns a future from a context:

```scala
onComplete ( ctx => Future { "hello" } ) {
  case Success(str) => ctx => println(str) // hello
  case Failure(ex) => throw ex
}
```

__onSuccess__

```scala
onSuccess[T](f: => Future[T])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext)
onSuccess[T](f: Context => Future[T])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext)
```

It waits for the completion of a future a passes the future result if successful into the inner action:

```scala
onSuccess ( Future { "hello" } ) { str =>
  ctx => println(str) // hello
}
```

It can also accept as a parameter a function that returns a future from a context:

```scala
onSuccess ( ctx => Future { "hello" } ) { str =>
  ctx => println(str) // hello
}
```

__onFailure__

```scala
onFailure[T](f: => Future[T])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext)
onFailure[T](f: Context => Future[T])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext)
```

It waits for the completion of a future a passes the future result if successful into the inner action:

```scala
onFailure ( Future { throw new Exception("Future failure") } ) { ex =>
  ctx => throw ex
}
```

It can also accept as a parameter a function that returns a future from a context:

```scala
onFailure ( ctx => Future { throw new Exception("Future failure") } ) { ex =>
  ctx => throw ex
}
```

__after__

```scala
after[T](delay: FiniteDuration)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext, ac: ActorContext)
```

It exectues the inner action after a given delay:

```scala
after ( 3 seconds ) {
  ctx => Unit
}
```

#### Custom Actions

All the actions above have same result type, which extends the following abstract class:

```scala
abstract class ChainableAction[L]
```

To create a custom action you can use the following 2 helper types:

```scala
type ChainableAction0 = ChainableAction[Unit]
type ChainableAction1[T] = ChainableAction[Tuple1[T]]
```

The first type returns a chainable action, which will call the inner action by passing only the context as an argument, while the second one will pass a custom value of type T that can be used by the inner action.

Let's use `mapContext` and `provide` as an example that return the 2 chainable action types:

```scala
def mapContext(f: Context => Context): ChainableAction0
def provide[T](value: T): ChainableAction1[T]
```

The ChainableAction0 will then have an apply method with the following signature:

```scala
def apply(fn: Action)
```

Where `Action` is a shorthand type for `Context => Unit`.

While for `ChainableAction1[String]` would be:

```scala
def apply(fn: String => Action)
```

To define a custom chainable action we can use the apply method defined on the `ChainableAction` companion object:

```scala
object ChainableAction {
  def apply[T: Tuple](f: (T => Action) => Action): ChainableAction[T]
}
```

or we can define the tapply method part of the abstract class `ChainableAction` directly:

```scala
abstract class ChainableAction[L](implicit val ev: Tuple[L]) {
  def tapply(f: L => Action): Action
}
```

Here's an example of a custom action that returns a `ChainableAction0`, which prints "hello" and then calls the inner action:

```scala
// define it
def printHello: ChainableAction0 = ChainableAction { inner =>
  ctx =>
    println("hello")
    inner(())(ctx)
  }

// then use it
printHello {
  ctx => ()
}
```

Here's an example of a custom action that returns a `ChainableAction1[Int]`, which passes a random integer to the inner action:

```scala
// define it
def randomize: ChainableAction1[Int] = ChainableAction { inner =>
  ctx =>
    val randomInt = scala.util.Random.nextInt
    inner(Tuple1(randomInt))(ctx)
}

// then use it
randomize { randomInt =>
  ctx => println(randomInt)
}
```
